## About The Project
QuizMaster is a Java-based quiz management system that allows users to take quizzes, track scores, and view leaderboards. It provides an interactive interface for quiz taking, supports multiple-choice questions, and offers features for managing user scores and displaying top performers.

## How it works?
1. Users can start a quiz session and answer a series of randomly selected questions.
2. The system calculates the score based on the user's answers and displays the result at the end of the quiz.
3. QuizMaster maintains a leaderboard to showcase top quiz scores achieved by different users.
